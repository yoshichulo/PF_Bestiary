# PF Bestiary

PF Bestiary is a Pathfinder built-in bestiary, where you are able to filter, search and look for +1500 beasts in _Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ volumes and _Pathfinder Adventure Path_ ones

It's oriented to show characteristics like:
+ Basic and advanced stats.
+ Name.
+ Description.
+ CR and XP.
+ Type and alignment.
+ All its abilities.
+ And more...

This is by far what is actually designed (not in code yet)
